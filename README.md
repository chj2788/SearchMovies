"SearchMovies" is a simple project I created to improve my front-end development knowledge. I practiced using React, Redux hooks, external API, and Styled components.

- Incorporate Redux hooks to architect highly scalable front-end state management and optimized components using React hooks.
- Combine best features of mobile app and web by deploying a Progressive Web App.
